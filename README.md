# EcoReserve-Optimization
Here's a summary of what each part of our Engineering Optimization project incorporating linear and integer programming will display:

### Part 1: Linear Programming Model
#### Objective:

Develop an LP model to maximize average animal welfare scores across the entire reserve while maintaining a profit margin of at least 5%.
#### Tasks:

Define data parameters, such as food costs, welfare values, animal species, and food requirements for young and adult animals.
Define variables related to the mix of food for each animal and investments in facilities.
Construct the LP model with constraints on food intake, investment limits, and profit margins.
#### Deliverables:

Data section with parameter definitions.
Variables section with variable definitions.
The LP model.

### Part 2: Model Implementation
#### Objective:
Implement and solve the LP model from Part 1 using Python and the gurobipy module.
#### Tasks:

Read data from the zoodata Excel spreadsheet using Python pandas.
Solve the LP model using gurobipy.

#### Deliverables:

Python code (.py file) that implements and solves the LP model.
Modified Excel files, if any changes were made.
Revised LP model if applicable.

### Part 3: Integer Programming Extension
#### Objective:

Expand the LP model to include integer programming components, accommodating new constraints and opportunities.
#### Tasks:

Incorporate adoption of up to 5 adults of each species, with special requirements.
Ensure that the model continues to maximize the average welfare score.
Consider new constraints such as moving big cat species to a new enclosure and renovating existing enclosures.
#### Deliverables:

Data section with updated parameter definitions.
Variables section with updated variable definitions.
The modified MIP (Mixed-Integer Programming) model.

### Part 4: Integer Programming Implementation
#### Objective:

Implement and solve the modified MIP model from Part 3 using Python and the gurobipy module.
#### Tasks:

Use Python to read data and solve the MIP model.
Write a short report explaining assumptions, the solution, and present the results in an easy-to-read format.
#### Deliverables:

Python code that implements and solves the MIP model.
Modified Excel files, if any changes were made.
A concise report explaining the assumptions, solution, and results.
These summaries capture the essence of each part, outlining the objectives, tasks, and deliverables required that our group delivered.
